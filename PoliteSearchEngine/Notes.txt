WE remove special characters before we remove stopwords. Should remove stopwords first.
Then special characters then some different other stopwords again.

We use stopwords differently.
For instance 
doc 1: Syria is better than Tyrkey
is equivalent with
doc 2: Turkey is better than Syria.
If the stopwords were removed(is, than)
But we do it differntly. We would have the following termlists
doc 1 termlist: "syria", "is better", "better", "than turkey", "turkey".
doc 2 termlist: "turkey", "is better", "better", "than syria", "syria".

We create use the stopwords to create coherence. Now the search term:
"syria better than turkey" = "syria", "better", "than turkey", "turkey"
Would give doc1 a better score than doc2. It's genious!

Separate Term Divider. So that it can be used when creating a termVector for the searchquery.

Create folders to have a sort of database.

PseudoCode for ContentRanking
	Foreach term in searchquery. Find term in in PostList. And add the integers to another list.
	Make that list distinct
	Now calculate the cosinesimilarity between normalizedvector with searchquery for the page id from the list of distict list.
	return list of links with cosine score.

	tf-idf for a term in a document is calculated when used.
		Get the documents that the term is involved in.
		Then create a score foreach document(tf-idf)
		When you come across a new document add it to the list else add the score to the document for the new term

	tf=  Term frequency. Already got that in termvector (freq)
	tf* = Relevance of a term frequency. Also got that (freqScore)
	df = Is in crawler called completeTermVector.(freq)
	idf = is in crawler called completeTermVector. (freqScore)
	wt = tf* * idf*
	norm-wt = wt / (sqroot(sum of each wt-term powered to two))


	FINAL ALGORITHM. STEP BY STEP!
		1. Foreach term look for the term in the postinglist and get the documents involved.
			a. Foreach document add it to a document list. If it already it exists don't add it.
			b. Get the tf*-idf* score for the term in each document and add it to the documents tf*--idf* score
		2. When all the terms has been scanned and added then you have completed the first step

	New algorihm.
		1. Foreach term look for the term in the postinglist and get the documents involved.
			a. Foreach document add it to a document list. If it already exists don't add it.(check)

		2. calculate the wt for the term in each doc. [check]

		3. calculate the document length for each document(this should only have to be done once.
			docLength = sqroot(wt,i^2 + wt,i+1^2 ... wt,n^2) [check]

		4. calculate norm for term and add it to the score
		5. Cosine

		6. Sort based on score.
		7. Display *links* based on score [FUCKING DOOOONE!!!!]
		 
		Der er en lille fejl. Den skal tage hele vægten af hele vector længden for dokumenter (og searchquery for den sags skyld).
			Det betyder også at document length er forkert.
